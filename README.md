# Recipe Tracking Application 

This Recipe App will allow a user to add new recipes, display a list of recipes and delete a recipe from the list by clicking a delete button.

I used Render to deploy the Recipe Tracking App: ![Recipe Tracking App](https://recipe-app-jjx4.onrender.com/)

### Specific Instructions
Find the TODO comments in the code and create the necessary functionality. Below is a list of specific items needed to complete this lesson.

The app will display a recipe's name, cuisine, photo, ingredients, preparation instructions and action buttons (delete).
Create at least one additional component that is used by the RecipeList component.
The app does not need to match the exact appearance of the mockup, but should be similar and pass the styling tests.
Add handlers and other attributes to the starter code as needed.
To create a recipe entry, the app will need to have a form with input fields for the name of the dish, the cuisine it belongs to, and an URL that points to a picture of the dish. Use `<textarea>` for the ingredients and preparation. For the tests to pass, use the following names for your inputs: `<input name="name">`, `<input name="cuisine">`, `<input name="photo">`, `<textarea name="ingredients">` and `<textarea name="preparation">`.

The new recipe must be added to the end of the list of recipes.
